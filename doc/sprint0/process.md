Reflect on how your team worked together.
* We split up some of the deliverables that are due for sprint 0 and assigned them to individual members and presented them to each other in the next meeting to finalize our work. Everyone finished what they were assigned.


How did you organize the team?  Which tools did you use, if any?
* We organized our teams through the use of Piazza, Discord, and Google Docs. We would coordinate our meeting and working times by either privately messaging each other on Discord, or through our Discord server for CSC301. We would work together on documentation through sharing a document on Google Docs.


How did you make decisions?
* All decisions we made so far were in the presence of all other group members. We all have similar timetables, so coordinating times to meet during the week were no problem at all. Decisions were finalized simply by verbal acknowledgement as we would discuss the decision together in a Discord call.


How did you define priority and/or points of user stories? How many rounds of voting (on average) did you need to come to a consensus for the point estimate?
* We prioritize user stories that mention features closely tied to our project objective, that is, to have a functional webpage that allows you to see games and other players. These user stories with important features took higher precedence over user stories that wanted quality of life features like blocking users, writing reports, and password changing. In general, it only took 1 round of voting to determine the order of the user stories as we could easily communicate our ideas quickly within each of our Discord call meetings.


How frequently did you meet?
* Twice to three times a week in Discord calls.


What lessons should you take forward to the next phase?
* We were a little tight on time, so we plan to start our work much earlier in Sprint 1.
