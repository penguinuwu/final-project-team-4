The Project Objective
* The objective of this project is to build a platform on the web for gamers to connect with each other by letting users find others based on specified optional criterias and through a matchmaking/queuing system. The site will give users the ability to post activities such as game reviews, videos, and screenshots.


The Key Personas
* Key Persona: Bob "xxxDarkKirito18xxx" Alexander - a 19-year-old university student who does not have many friends, but enjoys multiplier games. He is a walking encyclopedia of the video game Monster Hunter and desperately wants to find people to enjoy gaming with.
* Key Persona: Tom "Hanji" Cheng - A high ranking player in CS:GO is tired of CS:GOâ€™s poor matchmaking system. He decides to find other players of similar rank who have been commended on the site to insure he gets a good experience.
* Key Persona: Eve "Sheen" Jacobs - A casual gamer in Path of Exile and is trying to meet new people to enjoy her favorite games together. She is also open to trying out new games that are enjoyed by people who have similar interests as herself.


The Key Scenarios
* Key Scenario: Billy has no friends, but wants to play counter strike and valorant with other people that are near his skill level, silver 2.
* Key Scenario: XGamerX is tired of playing solo queue in league of legends with toxic players and would like to have someone to play with. They are simply looking for someone to play with so they can enjoy the game together.
* Key Scenario: Lolkekw is new to the game Bloons Tower Defense 6 and would like to have someone teach her about the core mechanics of the game.


The Key Principles
* Key Principle: Security - If the database were to be leaked, users should not have any personal data revealed.
* Key Principle: Safe environment - Users should be able to block and report other users freely; no user should feel trapped with other users.
* Key Principle: Anonymity - Users should always know what data must be public, and the users must be able to choose what optional data will be publicly shown.
