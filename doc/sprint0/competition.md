Our competition includes:
Steam: https://steamcommunity.com/
Discord: https://discord.com/

* How is your product different?
    Our website will allow you to login, and team up with players from any game at whatever your skill level is. The website will also allow you to chat with them and add people to your friends list. You will be able to add a multitude of games to your favourites list and set your skill level at those specific games, so that we can try to find other users at a similar skill level who are also looking for people to play with.

    Steam has these features, however does not give access to these features to games outside of their platform.

    Discord has no matchmaking systems, where instead you would actively have to join multiple gaming discords specifically for each game to look for players in each game.

* If your product is better for specific users and/or specific scenarios,
    * Who are the users and/or what are the scenarios?
        This website is for gamers who play a wide variety of games, or new players who are looking for people to play with.

    * Why do you think the competitors didnâ€™t focus on these users and/or scenarios?
        The issue with steam is that their platform only allows you to easily find people to play games with, on games that are already on the steam platform. Whereas our website will help you find players for any game.

    * And, what would it take from them to do so?
        Steam would not do this, since steam profits directly from the games that are on their own platform, they would want to only provide these services to games that are on their own platform. By adding these features such that it is accessible to other games, they are indirectly encouraging their users to play non-steam games. Our website does not have this issue as we dont own or profit from the sales of any of these games directly.

        Fundamentally, if discord wanted to implement matchmaking, they would have to significantly veer from their current streamlined feature of channel based chatting and gaming, they would have to make a completely separate and different application that does not synthesize well with the features they currently have.
