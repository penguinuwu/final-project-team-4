**Unfinished Tasks**
* There were no unfinished tasks for sprint 1.

**Good practices to continue**
* Timely completion of each task, good text communication through discord, vibing

**What are some new practices**
* We may need to move around some of the subtasks such that some chronological features and work distribution make more sense.
* Begin working on subtasks earlier.
* More efficient meetings
* Be more concise and clear on task/subtask descriptions.

**Harmful Practices**
* Some meetings lacked a clear end goal, so meetings often went on for very long with little progress.

**Best Experience**
* Jonathan is a cool guy.
