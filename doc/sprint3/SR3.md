## Unfinished Tasks

There were no unfinished tasks for sprint 3.

## Good practices to continue

Good text communication through discord, vibing

## What are some new practices

Begin working on subtasks earlier.
Be more concise and clear on task/subtask descriptions.

## Harmful Practices

Our subtask completion order was messy. We did not specify enough subtasks in the beginning, so we needed to add more later in the sprint.

## Best Experience

Vaishvik is a pog guy.
